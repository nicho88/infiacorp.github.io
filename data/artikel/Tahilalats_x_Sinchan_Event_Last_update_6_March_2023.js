    '<p>At the end of 2022, there was a collaboration that attracted the attention of many people. The character of Tahilalats meets a Japanese cartoon character, Crayon Shinchan in a long term collaboration, with a theme "First Japanese x Indonesian Crossover Character". The collaboration was made to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of Crayon Shinchan.</p><p>The collaboration of Tahilalats x Crayon Shinchan turned out to be a very good start. This can be seen in the emergence of a Korean brand, Locknlock, which has released a collection of cutlery sets from Tahilalats x Crayon Shinchan editions. More recently, from January 25 to February 24, 2023, local skincare brand Somethic released a special edition of the Tahilalats x Crayon Shinchan collaboration.</p>',
