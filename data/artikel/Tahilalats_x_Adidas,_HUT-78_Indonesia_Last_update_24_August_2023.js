  description:
    "As the largest archipelago in the world, Indonesia is a place where many cultures and diversity meet.\n    This makes Indonesia a country rich with differences. To celebrate the diversity of life in Indonesia, Adidas has partnered  with Tahilalats,\n    a local artist known for his comic strips. Tahilalats' work is close to people's hearts as it highlights the daily lives of Indonesians. Inspired by the\n    motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, this special edition T-shirt contains Tahilalats' signature characters and portrays activities that are synonymous with the\n    diversity of Indonesian society.",
